Markov Babbler

After being trained on text from various authors, it will
'babble' (generate random walks) and produce text that
vaguely sounds like the author of the training texts.

# ------------------- Implementation Details: -------------------------------
# Our entire graph is a dictionary
#   - keys/states are ngrams represented (could have been tuple, CANNOT be a list,
#       because we need to use states as dictionary keys, and lists are not hashable)
#   - values are either lists or Bags
# Starter states are a list of words (could have been a Bag; either an ordered or unordered collection, with duplicates allowed)
# When we pick a word, we transition to a new state
# e.g. suppose we are using bigrams and are at the state ‘the dog’ and we pick the word ‘runs’. 
# Our new state is ‘dog runs’, so we look up that state in our dictionary, and then get the next word, and so on…
# Ending states can generate a special "stop" symbol; we will use ‘EOL’.
#   If we generate the word ‘EOL’, then the sentence is over. Since all words are lower-case, this won’t be confused for a legitimate word

# read through all the comments in the below functions before beginning to code

# our successors (the value for each key in our dictionary) are strings representing words (not states, since n-gram states could be of multiple words)
# since we will represent your n-grams as strings, remember to separate words with a space 
# when updating your state, make sure you don't end up with extra spaces or you won't find it in the dictionary
# add print statements while debugging to ensure is step in your process is working as intended
